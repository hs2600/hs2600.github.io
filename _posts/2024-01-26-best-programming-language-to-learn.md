What Are the Different Types of Programming Languages?[](#what-are-the-different-types-of-programming-languages)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some of the most popular web development technologies to learn

Every programming language is different. While each programming language has its unique syntax, how it’s written, run, and compiled can change everything.

Many developers prefer to work with certain types of languages. It’s also a lot easier to migrate between similar languages, so the first programming language you learn matters.

So what are the different types of programming languages? There’s a [difference between scripting and programming languages](/blog/scripting-languages/#scripting-languages-vs-programming-languages)? Let’s take a look.

*   **Programming languages** can be just about anything, but they’re often best for software development as they can be used on various platforms and tend to be compiled rather than interpreted. Most programming languages are intended for software development, to develop programs you download and run on your device.
*   **Scripting languages** are just the opposite. They’re often interpreted, which means their code runs on the fly rather than going through a compiling process inside a program. Web development languages are often scripting languages.
*   **Markup languages** aren’t precisely programming languages, but they’re used for web development. These are human-readable tags used to format a document.
*   **Web development languages** are specialized for creating websites, either in the frontend or backend.
*   **Frontend (or client-side) languages** change a website in the user’s browser. For instance, clicking something on the website and producing an animation would result from frontend programming like CSS, HTML5, and JavaScript. It’s usually a combination of all the above languages.
*   **Backend (or server-side) languages** change a site from the server or application layer. For example, submitting form data, or changing something in the database, is backend programming.

You should also note that many people just use “programming languages” to refer to all coding languages as a whole. A scripting language is a specialized programming language, but not all programming languages are scripting languages.

Not all languages below are programming languages in the strictest sense, but they’re all used for coding.

It’s time to dive in!

HTML and CSS[](#html-and-css)
-----------------------------

HTML5 and CSS3 logos

Though HTML and CSS aren’t technically programming languages, HTML5 and CSS3 are the ideal places to start if you want to be a front-end web developer. This duo makes up the building blocks of any webpage, with HTML structuring a page’s content, and CSS styling and modifying that structure.

HTML and CSS are a great jumping-off point for any young developer. While HTML is an easy-to-learn markup language, CSS will challenge you a bit more, but it’s not incredibly difficult to pick up either.

**Platform**

Frontend web development.

**Difficulty**

HTML is straightforward to learn; CSS is also reasonably easy to learn.

**Popularity**

**Average Salary**

[$64k/year](https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=HTML_CSS_Developer/Salary), according to PayScale. Also, check out the average web designer’s salary.

**Advantages**

It is practically required to be a frontend web developer. Very easy to learn, even for people with no programming experience. Its high popularity makes finding free resources easy. Well-supported on all devices.

**Disadvantages**

It doesn’t net you an exceptionally high salary because it’s a requirement for all frontend web development jobs. Cross-browser issues are always a concern.

JavaScript[](#javascript)
-------------------------

JavaScript community logo

Though HTML and CSS are must-haves for frontend web developers, JavaScript is overwhelmingly popular. While HTML structures and CSS styles, JavaScript adds advanced client-side functions to a webpage.

Unlike HTML and CSS, JavaScript is a real programming and scripting language. It means you can do far more with it, but it’s also a bit harder to learn. Still, if you want to develop more than just a flat page, you almost definitely need to know JavaScript.

**Platform**

Frontend scripting. Rarely used for mobile/software development.

**Difficulty**

JavaScript is a real programming language, so those coming straight from HTML and CSS may have difficulty with it. Compared to other languages, it’s moderately easy to learn.

**Popularity**

Very popular, often going hand in hand with HTML and CSS. [#3](https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html) in PYPL Popularity Index of Feb. 2021.

Which Programming Language Is the Best?[](#which-programming-language-is-the-best)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There’s no clear answer on which coding language is best. Each has its pros and cons and shines in different situations. But when it comes to specific categories, there are a few clear winners. These are the best languages for:

*   **Beginners:** For the absolute easiest languages to learn, even if you have no experience at all, start with HTML/CSS, Go, Ruby, [PHP](/blog/php-tutorials), or Python.
*   **Web developers:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are a necessity for frontend developers. Backend developers should look into Ruby, Python, PHP, and Go. And, of course, SQL for database management.
*   **Software developers:** C++ is undoubtedly the most powerful. But don’t overlook Rust, Python, Scala, or C#. It all depends on the software you’re building.
*   ****Mobile developers:**** Swift is best for iOS, and Kotlin for Android. But general-purpose languages like C++ and Java can work well too.
*   **High salary:** Swift, Rust, Scala, Kotlin, and Go all help you earn about $100k/year, with Scala and Go generating the highest salaries. Also, check out our developer salaries for various positions.
*   **Popularity:** Python is highly popular, and considering its versatility, it stands to stay at the top for a long time. JavaScript, Java, C#, and C++ are also quite popular themselves.
*   ****Flexibility:**** C++ might be the giant in flexibility, but Rust, Java, Scala, Kotlin, and Python all work well cross-platform and in various situations.

Summary[](#summary)
-------------------

Picking a single programming language from a list isn’t an easy task. But if you know what you want to do and where to start, it’s much easier to sort that list down into a few of the best candidates. That’s true whether you want the “hottest” language, the one with the best salary, or just those that are easiest to learn.

Learning how to program will net you one of the most flexible jobs you can get, allowing you to work remotely and choose whatever technologies you prefer. While no one programming language is the best of them all, a push in the right direction can help you choose the right one.

Get coding!
