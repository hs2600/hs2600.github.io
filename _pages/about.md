> Leveraging over 20 years of hands-on experience in the tech industry, I bring a unique blend of academic rigor (B.A. in Computer Technology, Cal State 2019) and cutting-edge expertise in cybersecurity (M.Sc. Cybersecurity, Cal State 2021).

I'm currently pouring my heart and soul into building a [SaaS](https://nefcloud.com){:target="_blank"} startup, an exhilarating journey where every day brings new challenges and exciting discoveries. It's like navigating uncharted territory in the tech world, learning from every twist and turn. While code might be my compass, the community is my fuel â€“ that's why I share my adventures and insights on Twitter. If you're curious about the startup roller coaster, the thrill of innovation, or the nitty-gritty of building from the ground up, join me on the ride at [@hsantoyo_sec](https://twitter.com/hsantoyo_sec){:target="_blank"}! You'll find code snippets, insightful threads, and maybe even a few laughs along the way.
